Click on the |launch_binder| buttons below to go to live Jupyter Notebooks hosted by `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org/>`_. The programming experience is very similar to running Jupyter locally. You can even use the environment on a mobile phone or tablet! They might take a minute to load the first time, be patient.

.. warning::
   The code you write in these notebooks files will not be saved online. To save, you must download the notebook file or save to your browser storage. Downloading might not be possible if you are on a mobile device!
