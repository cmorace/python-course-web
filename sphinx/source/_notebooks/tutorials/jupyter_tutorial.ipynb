    "[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) run bits of code interactively and are great environments for learning to program with Python. They can run as a web-application inside a web-browser or inside an integrated development environment such as VS Code. To use Jupyter notebooks you must have Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to install Anaconda, which includes both Python and Jupyter. If you haven't installed Anaconda yet, see the [installation instructions](../../environment_setup.rst#Anaconda).\n",

In command mode, we can create new cells, delete existing cells, of change the type of cell to either a morkdown cell or a code cell. In edit mode, we can edit and execute a cell's content (either markdown or Python code). To enter command mode click on the side bar to the left side of the cell.
