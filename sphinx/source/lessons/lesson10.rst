Lesson 10
=============


Individual Project Overview
------------------------------
Time to get creative.

You can create anything you want.

- game
- animation
- story
- musical instrument
- application/tool, etc.


The only requirement is that your program implements an **animation cycle**.

But you only have two hours of class time, plus
however much time you want to work at home this week.
Practice your time-management skills!

Today's Plan
------------------

If you are not sure where to begin, I recommend the following steps

1. Brainstorming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - What kind of project do you want to create? Game/Art/Tool/Story/Puzzle?

   - What was the most fun project for you this semester? Why?

   - How can you use animation to make your project more exciting/interesting?

   - If your project is a game or story:
     Where does it take place? Who are the characters?


2. Decomposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Break your project down into smaller and smaller sub-problems to solve.
   - What are your Sprites? What do they do?
   - What are the different states of your animation cycle?
   - Draw a **state transition diagram**.

      - Label your states and draw them in circles.
      - Draw arrows for state transitions. For each state transition:

         - Write the necessary condition for the transition to occur.
         - Write any steps needed before transitioning to the new state.


3. Planning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Write a to-do list with your decomposed sub-problems.
   - Estimate the time needed for each task.
   - Make sure you have enough time to finish.


4. Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Start programming at a **high-level**.
   You do not need to implement all of the details at first.

   - What classes and functions do you need.
     Initially, I like to use ``pass`` in the parts I will implement later.
   - What methods and properties does each class needs.
   - Once the structure of your code is complete,
     then start implementing the details.

Presentation
--------------------------------

Next week we will present our projects at the beginning of class.
Your presentation should be **no more than 5 minutes**.

I recommend your presentation includes:

1. Introduction (~1 minute)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Tell us about your project (don't show us yet).
   - What is it? A game, animation, or something else?
   - What happens in your project?
   - Any specific reason why you decided to create it?
   - What do you think is interesting about it? Why?

2. Demo (~1-2 minutes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - Run your code and show the class how it works.
   - Is it interactive? How do you use/play it?

3. Discuss the Implementation (~1-2 minutes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - How did you decompose the problem? What were the sub-problems you solved?
   - What was the most challenging part?
   - Describe the animation cycle and how you implemented it.
   - If you had more time, what else would you add?

4. Questions and Comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   - The class will ask you questions and give constructive feedback.
