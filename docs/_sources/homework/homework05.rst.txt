In this homework, we will use a Jupyter notebook. To see a preview click `here <../_notebooks/homework/hw05.ipynb>`_.

You can :download:`download this file <../_notebooks/homework/hw05.ipynb>` and open it with the ``jupyter notebook`` bash command or open it in VSCode.


Otherwise, |launch_binder|_, and work on it online. Just be aware that Binder will not save your work online. Instead, you must download your finished work before closing down your browser.

We covered the basics of Jupyter in class, but if your want more information, check the `tutorial <tutorial.rst>`_.

Try to finish as much as you can. If you don't know how to do some of the problems, it's ok. But, please, email me (cmorace.public@gmail.com) your work before the start of the next class.
