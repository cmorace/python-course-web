In this homework, we will use Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is an interactive programming environment. To see a preview click `here <../_notebooks/homework/hw01.ipynb>`_.

If you have python installed on your home computer, you can :download:`download this file <../_notebooks/homework/hw01.ipynb>` and open it with ``jupyter notebook`` or VSCode.

Otherwise, please |launch_binder|_ and work on it online. Just be aware that Binder will not save your work online. You must download your finished work before closing down your browser.

We covered the basics of Jupyter in class, but if your want more information, check the `tutorial <tutorial.rst>`_.

Try to finish as much as you can, but if you don't know how to do some of the problems, that's ok. Please, email me your work before the start of next class,
cmorace.public@gmail.com.
