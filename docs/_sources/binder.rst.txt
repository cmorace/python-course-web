===============

You can go to the links below to play with Python in an online editor hosted by `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org/>`_. The programming experience is very similar to running Jupyter locally, but lets you get started programming with Python right away, even if you have trouble setting up Python and Jupyter on your personal computer.
