Homework
========
Most of the homework will be distributed as Jupyter notebooks which you can download below. You can preview the homework by clicking on the links under `Preview`_.

Downloads
----------

To complete the assignments you should have Anaconda installed. If you have not installed Anaconda yet, see the `Anaconda installation instructions <setup.rst>`_. 

You can complete the assignments by downloading the `.ipynb` file and opening the file with VS Code or the Jupyter Notebook web application. The `Jupyter tutorial <_notebooks/tutorials/jupyter_tutorial.ipynb>`_ has information about using jupyter notebooks if you are unfamiliar.

.. note::
   You must be using a desktop computer to download the homework files.
