Python Setup
=============

You can follow the steps below to setup your personal computer with a similar programming environment that we use in class. These methods may slightly vary depending on which operating system you are running (i.e.. Windows, MacOS, or Linux).

Anaconda
---------------
 The simplest way to install Python is to download the `Anaconda installer <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>`_ for your operating system and follow the installer's instructions.

 .. note::

    Select the option to add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable.

Visual Studio Code
------------------
After installing Anaconda, download `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download>`_.
After installation is complete you will need to install the `Python extension for Visual Studio Code <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_


pycat
------
pycat is a Python library we are currently developing specifically for this class. You can get the latest version `here <https://bitbucket.org/dwhite0/pycat/get/master.zip>`_


Optional Software
-----------------

If you have installed Anaconda, Visual Studio Code, and pycat, then you have all of the software needed to develop python programs and the game/graphics applications we develop in class. The following software is optional but highly recommended.
